This is a two factor authentication mobile app. I made this app to be the best, but I am not skilled enough to do that.
I used this project to try to learn Jetpack Compose. I still don't really understand it.

## Installation

I just couldn't find a way to build the apk in jetpack compose. If somebody knows how to do it, please help me.
If you want to try the app, you can use Android Studio to install the app.
